                <h1>Introduction to Photography</h1>
                <p>Photography is an art form that captures moments in time.

                <h2>Camera Basics</h2>
                <p>Understanding how a camera works is crucial for any photographer. A camera typically consists of three key components: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. These three settings control the exposure of an image and how it appears. Mastering the balance between them allows you to achieve the desired effect in your photos.</p>

                <h2>Lighting in Photography</h2>
                <p>Lighting is one of the most important aspects of photography. It can dramatically change the mood and feel of an image. Photographers use natural light, artificial light, and a combination of both to create different effects. The quality, direction, and color of light should always be considered when capturing an image.</p>

By carefully placing subjects and elements within the frame, photographers can guide the viewer's eye and tell a compelling story through their images.</p>
